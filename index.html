		<h3>
			Paul Dennis: The Portfolio
		</h3>
		Welcome to my portfolio! Right now it is under construction so please pardon the virtual dust.<br><br>

		My Github: <a href="https://github.com/pauldennis2/">https://github.com/pauldennis2/</a>

		Here are some projects I have worked on:<br><br>
	
		<div class="w600">
			<h4>
				Simplicity - Final Project
			</h4>
			Github: <a href="https://github.com/pauldennis2/Simplicity-Webapp">https://github.com/pauldennis2/Simplicity-Webapp</a> <br>
			Try it out: <a href="https://simplicity-4x.herokuapp.com/">https://simplicity-4x.herokuapp.com/</a> <br><br>

			Description: Simplicity is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X">"4X"</a> style strategy game inspired by
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascendancy_(video_game)">Ascendancy</a>, a game I enjoyed a lot as a kid.
			Players start with one planet and must expand, colonizing new planets, researching new technologies, and developing
			a galactic empire.<br>

			<h4>
				Mastermind Web App
			</h4>
			Github: <a href="https://github.com/pauldennis2/mastermind-webapp">https://github.com/pauldennis2/mastermind-webapp</a> <br>
			Try it out: <a href="https://tiy-paul-mastermind.herokuapp.com">https://tiy-paul-mastermind.herokuapp.com</a> <br><br>

			Description: Mastermind is a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">board game</a>. One
			of our class assignments was developing this as a web app. In order to practice my front-end skills I decided to implement
			a drag and drop interface, since this is a more intuitive way to play the game. The game includes several configurable 
			settings. Enjoy!<br>

			<h4>
				Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
			</h4>
			Github: <a href="https://github.com/pauldennis2/ultimate-tic-tac-toe">https://github.com/pauldennis2/ultimate-tic-tac-toe</a> <br>
			(Not a web-app, not hosted on Heroku) <br><br>

			Description: Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (TTT) is a much more complex, somewhat recursive version of regular TTT. The Ultimate board
			has nine squares, like regular TTT, each containing its own TTT board. Players have to get three boards in a row to win, and your
			opponent's previous move determines your range of possible moves. I developed a heuristic algorithm for a computer to use to play
			the game intelligently.
